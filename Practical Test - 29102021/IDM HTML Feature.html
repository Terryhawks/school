  <div class="T1">
    <div class="TT1 tmultiple">Download Speed Acceleration</div>
    <div class="TP1 pmultiple">Internet Download Manager will accelerate downloads by up to 5 times due to its smart dynamic file segmentation technology. Unlike other download managers and accelerators, Internet Download Manager segments downloaded files dynamically during download process, and it reuses available connections without additional connect and login stages to achieve the best possible acceleration performance.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="T2">
    <div class="TT2 tmultiple">Download files from your favorite web sites</div>
    <div class="TP2 pmultiple">After installing "IDM integration module" browser extension, just continue surfing the Internet, and you will be amazed how easy is to download everything you want from your favorite web sites.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="T3">
    <div class="TT3 tmultiple">All popular browsers are supported</div>
    <div class="TP3 pmultiple">IDM integrates seamlessly into Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer, Safari, MSN Explorer, AOL, Mozilla Firebird, Avant Browser, Maxthon, and all other popular browsers to automatically handle your downloads.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="T4">
    <div class="TT4 tmultiple">Easy downloading with one click</div>
    <div class="TP4 pmultiple">When you click on a download link in a browser, IDM will take over the download and accelerate it. You don't need to do anything special, just browse the Internet as you usually do. IDM will catch your downloads and accelerate them. IDM supports HTTP, FTP, HTTPS and MMS protocols.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="T5">
    <div class="TT5 tmultiple">Dark theme</div>
    <div class="TP5 pmultiple">IDM dark theme displays dark surfaces across the majority of its UI. It was designed to be a supplemental mode to a default (or light) theme. The dark theme reduces the luminance emitted by your screen, while still meeting minimum color contrast ratios. It helps to improve visual ergonomics by reducing eye strain, adjusting brightness to current lighting conditions, and facilitating screen use in dark environments while conserving power.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="T6">
    <div class="TT6 tmultiple">Dynamic segmentation</div>
    <div class="TP6 pmultiple">Internet Download Manager has optimized file download logic. IDM divides downloaded file on file segments dynamically, unlike other download accelerators that divide downloaded file in segments once just before download process starts. Dynamic segmentation gives significant download performance improvement. When file download starts, it's unclear how many connections may be opened. When new connection becomes available IDM finds the largest segment to download and divide it in half. Thus new connection starts downloading file from the half of the largest file segment. IDM minimizes the time needed for negotiations with servers and keeps all connections busy.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="T7">
    <div class="TT7 tmultiple">Download Resume</div>
    <div class="TP7 pmultiple">Internet Download Manager will resume unfinished download from the place where they left off. Comprehensive error recovery and resume capability will restart broken or interrupted downloads due to lost or dropped connections, network problems, computer shutdowns, or unexpected power outages.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="T8">
    <div class="TT8 tmultiple">Built-in Scheduler</div>
    <div class="TP8 pmultiple">Internet Download Manager can connect to the Internet at a set time, download the files you want, disconnect, or shut down your computer when it's done. You can also synchronize changes using periodic synchronization of files. It's possible to create and schedule several download queues for downloading or synchronization.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="T9">
    <div class="TT9 tmultiple">IDM includes web site spider and grabber</div>
    <div class="TP9 pmultiple">IDM downloads all required files that are specified with filters from web sites, for example all pictures from a web site, or subsets of web sites, or complete web sites for offline browsing. It's possible to schedule multiple grabber projects to run them once at a specified time, stop them at a specified time, or run periodically to synchronize changes.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="T10">
    <div class="TT10 tmultiple">Customizable Interface</div>
    <div class="TP10 pmultiple">You may choose the order, buttons, and columns to appear on the main IDM window. There are several different skins for the toolbar with different button styles. All skins can be downloaded from IDM home site. Also users can design their own skins.</div>
